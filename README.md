# proxmark_lf_pyramid_brute
Bruteforce attack against Pyramid readers using the Proxmark Development Kit.

This was a project inspired by proxbrute (https://github.com/brad-anton/proxbrute) writen by Brad Antoniewicz.
I wanted something similar for Pyramid readers, and wanted more control. So i wrote this.

I dont know LUA, so i used a script (lf_bulk_program.lua) written by Brian Redbeard as a starting point.

Usage: put lf_pyramid_brute.lua in the script folder of your proxmark client, then type: script run lf_pyramid_brute
